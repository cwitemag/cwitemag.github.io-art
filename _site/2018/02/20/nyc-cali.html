<p>As the saying goes:</p>

<p><em>” Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. “</em></p>

<p>Don’t let the money fool you nor let the easiness lure you. Life is about maintaining a balance.</p>

<p>Even Charles Darwin said:</p>

<p><em>” It’s not the strongest species that survive, but the one that is most adaptive to change. “</em></p>
