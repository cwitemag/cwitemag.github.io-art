### Never settle...
As the saying goes: 

*" Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. "*

Don't let the money fool you nor let the easiness lure you. Life is about maintaining a balance.

### Adaptive to change...
Even Charles Darwin said: 

*" It's not the strongest species that survive, but the one that is most adaptive to change. "*
